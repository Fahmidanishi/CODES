Overfitting vs Underfitting
Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems in machine learning model training.
1. Underfitting:
- The model is too simple and cannot capture the data patterns.
- It results in high bias and poor performance on both training and test data.
- Example: A straight-line model trying to fit complex data.
2. Overfitting:
- The model is too complex and memorizes the training data instead of learning patterns.
- It results in high variance and poor performance on new/unseen data.
- Example: A model fitting every noise and fluctuation in data.
3. Good Fit:
- The model captures the underlying trend well without being too complex or too simple.
